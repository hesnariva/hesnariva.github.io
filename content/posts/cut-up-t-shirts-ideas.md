What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
