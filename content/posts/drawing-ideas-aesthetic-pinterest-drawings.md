what is creativity?
What is creativity? Itâ€™s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
Itâ€™s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, itâ€™s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldnâ€™t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world thatâ€™s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.
