What are some types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new approach to an old problem. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation can also come from changing how we do things or even changing how we think about things. There are many types of innovation, but some of the most common are: 
1) Technology: This refers to any new way of doing things that has the potential to improve people's lives. Examples include mobile phone technology, email, and online shopping. 
2) Social Media: This refers to any new way of spreading information or ideas around the internet. It can be used for marketing and advertising, or just to keep people up-to-date on current events.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.
