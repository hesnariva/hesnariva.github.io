what is creative art?
Creative art is a form of expression that utilizes one or more creative mediums to convey feelings, thoughts, or ideas. The world of creative art is vast and ever-changing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of human endeavor.
There are countless forms of creative art, each with its own unique purpose and audience. Whether it’s a painting hung in a gallery or a performance piece staged in front of an audience, creative art has the power to provoke emotion and inspire thought.

At its core, creative art is about communication. It’s a way for artists to share their vision with the world, and for audiences to connect with the artist on a deeper level.
