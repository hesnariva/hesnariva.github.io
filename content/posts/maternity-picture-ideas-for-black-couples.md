The role of invention in innovation: What benefits can it bring to businesses?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new design, product or service that is different from those currently in use. It can have a number of benefits for businesses, including increasing efficiency and saving time. For example, the discovery of a new vaccine could lead to saved lives and reduced TB cases. There are also plenty of other examples where innovation can have significant impacts on businesses. For example, the development of new transportation methods could lead to increased efficiency in travel or the development of new materials that can improve quality control processes.

What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas: 
1. Start with one. This may seem like a ridiculously simple suggestion, but if you don’t have any big ideas to start with, you won’t be able to come up with anything great. After all, success isn’t about having a lot of small accomplishments; it’s about achieving great things starting small. 
2. Take things one step at a time.

Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.
