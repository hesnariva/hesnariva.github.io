Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.
